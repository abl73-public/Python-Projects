# Python-Projects

These are small projects I made using Python. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.

## Projects

- [Phone Book](https://github.com/abl73-public/Python-Projects/tree/main/File-Transfer)

- [File Transfer (Check Files Gui)](https://github.com/abl73-public/Python-Projects/tree/main/Phone-Book)

### Phone Book

This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.

### File Transfer (Check Files Gui)

This project allows the user to choose transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
